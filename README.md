## Home Assistant Dashboard through VNC

_Note_: This is a pre-release, it mostly works on my iPad2, most of the time, but unless you want to fiddle I'd wait a bit.

_Note_: This fork has been optimized for retina display usage. Set `2048x1536` in the configuration to display on a retina device with `1024x768` native (non-retina) resolution.


Simple add-on which allows you to view and interact with a dashboard (or any other webpage) through a modern chromium instance inside a noVNC webpage.

Very useful in case your browser don't support all the newfangled webstuff but enough to work with older versions of noVNC.

For example the iPad2.

## Usage
Clone into your /addons/ folder (you need a way to access that, outside of the scope of this documentation currently). Refresh the addons page and install it.

## Tips
[Kiosk-mode](https://github.com/NemesisRE/kiosk-mode) is really useful for a cleaner look.

[ha-lcars](https://github.com/th3jesta/ha-lcars) for the one true interface (as seen in my example photo).
